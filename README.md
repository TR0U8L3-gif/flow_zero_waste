# FlowZeroWasteApp – Food Rescue Mobile Application

## 📌 Project Overview

**FlowZeroWasteApp** is a mobile application designed to support the idea of reducing food waste. It enables users to quickly and easily locate nearby places offering surplus food – such as restaurants, bakeries, or shops. The main goal of the project is to increase accessibility and public awareness about food rescue, while also supporting small local businesses that cannot afford traditional advertising.

## 🧩 The Problem

Food waste is a serious socio-environmental issue. Its main causes include:

* Lack of consumer awareness
* Poor resource management
* Absence of intuitive tools for sharing information about surplus food

The goal of the application was to create a **simple, user-friendly, and modern platform** that:

* Allows businesses to post food offers that would otherwise go to waste
* Helps consumers quickly find those offers in their local area
* Works in real-time, with a focus on ease of use and a positive user experience

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology

The app was built using a layered architecture with clear separation of:

* **Presentation layer** – responsible for the user interface
* **Domain layer** – handles the business logic
* **Data layer** – manages database and API communication

Additionally, a detailed **class diagram** was created for the authentication functionality to better understand and plan the modular structure of the application.

## 🔧 Project Management – Git Flow

Version control was managed using the **Git Flow** strategy, which includes:

* `main` – stable production-ready version
* `development` – main development branch
* `feature/*` – feature-specific branches
* `release/*` – pre-release testing and refinement
* `hotfix/*` – emergency fixes for production

This branching model helped maintain clarity, order, and high code quality throughout the development process.
